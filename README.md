# Description
    This game is a very simple, one-player version of the childhood classic Hangman. The theme is based off of the song "Renegade" by Styx. On launch you will be directed to the main page where you will be able to click 'PLAY'. This link will direct you to the game page. To play you must enter a letter of your choosing into the text field and click 'Guess'. The secret words (lyrics from "Renegade") are randomized and the player must try to guess what the word is. The plaeyer has six "lives" allowing them to incorrectly guess six times. If the player incorectly guesses six times, they will receive an alert saying they have lost. If the player correctly guesses the secret word, they will receive an alert saying they won the game. From there the player can click 'New Game' to try again with a new randomly generated secret word.
